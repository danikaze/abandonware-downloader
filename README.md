[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danikaze/abandonware-downloader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danikaze/abandonware-downloader)

Small, personal project to play with [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/).

It crawls webs with abandonware to download them.

## Motivation

I love abandonware. Everyone who's been born in the in the `90s or before should!

The thing is, now, there are games providers ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com), [GoG](https://www.gog.com/), etc.) but, what happens if _someday_ this sites stop working? Also, this sites don't provide **all** kind of old games (there are some honorable mentions, but come on, you know it's true).
